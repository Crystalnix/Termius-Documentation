##I’ve got the error message “Terminal encoding UTF-8 is different. To avoid data corruption change terminal encoding”
Although UTF-8 is, currently, the most popular encoding, it may occur that you’re connecting to a host supporting a different character encoding, such as ASCII or ISO/IEC 8859-1.

In case you use iOS or the Chrome extension, Termius only supports UTF-8 character encoding momentarily. We will, however, add support for different character sets in the near future.

Android users are in luck though, the charset option under host settings allows you to alter the character encoding of the terminal.
