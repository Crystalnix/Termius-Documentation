##I love to multitask, but every time I hop between apps, the connection drops, why?

You’re most probably on iOS.Unfortunately, Apple’s policy does not allow applications to stay active in the background. Once an application gets pushed into the background all operations cease and result in a time-out within 3 minutes. As for today, we haven’t solved this issue. 

However, with the soon to be introduced Split View, you may run Serverauditor side-by-side with other applications instead.
