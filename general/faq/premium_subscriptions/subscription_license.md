## Can't I just pay once instead of annually, to get Termius Premium?

We have decided to distribute Termius Premium under a subscription-based licensing model for several reasons. 

First and foremost, Termius is a product that is always under development, we strive to stay in track of the ever-evolving market. Termius agrees with the latest trends technology-wise, security-wise and regarding UX/UI and functionality. We believe that a Subscription-based distribution allows long-term development and investment. Guaranteeing quality software, today and tomorrow.

What's more? Premium users get cross-platform synchronization. We make sure that the user data you produce is synchronized across all the devices you'll use. To do so we run a secure zero-knowledge data store in the cloud (AWS).
