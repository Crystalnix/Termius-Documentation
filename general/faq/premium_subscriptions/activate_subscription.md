## I've got a Premium subscription, but nothing has changed

After getting a Premium subscription you should register your Termius account:

1. Open Termius on your device
2. Navigate to the `settings` screen and tap `Restore subscription`
3. You will be prompted to sign in or register a new account
4. Select `Register` and fill out the fields

That's all! Now you'll be able to log in with your account on any supported platform.
