## FAQ Why a subscription and not a one-off purchase?

> *“I understand you're trying to milk every penny from your users, but please for the love of god ... make it a one-time purchase”* — anonymous

Once in awhile the user asks us whether it would be possible [to make a one-off deal instead of getting a subscription](http://support.termius.com/forums/243649-ios-platform/suggestions/17341414-one-time-purchase). Although we like money as much as the next guy, at Termius we believe that great software is honest and sustainable. This means that we are creating a __service that helps you getting the job done__, *not only today but also tomorrow*!

For a product like Termius, it is essential to always agree with the latest standards in security, and staying up-to-date feature-wise. In this pursuit, we continuously and steadily develop Termius. Take for instance our Cross-device sync, with Termius Premium you may securely connect to a remote computer using the device you have a hand, regardless of platform, Android, iOS, Chrome OS, Windows, MacOS or Unix. You’ll always have all essential data at hand.

__The subscription based sales model is a knife that cuts on both edges__. As user you pay as you go, that means you rather pay for the usage of Termius. Meanwhile the continuous income makes sure that we will have the necessary funds for development, making sure you get to get all the cool, up-to-date features.

*Honest, and sustainable*.
