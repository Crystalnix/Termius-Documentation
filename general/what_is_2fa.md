# What is 2FA?
###### [[Termius Documentation](../README.md) > [General](README.md)]

At Termius we understand that the credentials and hosts you store are extremely valuable. Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your Termius account. On top of the usual login sequence, there is a second factor, or barrier. You have to identify yourself using a token that is sent to a predefined device, like your cell phone.

Normally you use your username and password to log-in. With 2FA you have to use your username, password, and a unique token. To generate this unique token, Termius uses [Authy](https://www.authy.com). Authy makes 2FA really easy and secure, it keeps all your tokens in one place and is compatible with a myriad of other applications that use Authy 2FA as well.

## How to enable 2FA

2FA is disabled by default. You may enable it under the account options. Make sure you have Authy activated.

- Fill out your phone number
- An Auth Token will be sent to your Authy App
- Enter the Auth Token

##### *! Note*
2FA is linked to the Termius account. Activating 2FA with Authy on one device activates 2FA on all your devices with the same user account!
