## Add a host

Make sure you are on the `Hosts` screen. Tap the menu button in the top-left corner, then tap hosts.

To get started, you should tap the blue `+` button in the lower-left corner. Then tap `New Host`.

Enter an alias; this could be Raspberry Pi, for example. Then enter the IP address or hostname under hostname. Fill in the username and password and hit the tick `âœ“` in the top right corner.

> **!** IP address, hostname, and credentials are unique to the host you connect with.
