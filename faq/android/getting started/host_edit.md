## Edit or delete a host
A connection might be unsuccessful due to various reasons. For instance, you might have made a typo or the IP address or credentials have changed. In such case, you need to update the host.

Make sure you are on the `Hosts` screen. Tap the menu button in the top left corner, then tap hosts.

Navigate to the host you want to modify, tap and hold, until a blue circle with a tick appears. Now in the top right corner, tap the dustbin ![](images/dustbin.png) to delete the host, or the pencil ![](images/pencil.png) to alter the host details. 

After editing the details hit the tick `âœ“` in the top right corner, to save the changes.
