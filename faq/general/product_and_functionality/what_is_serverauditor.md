## What is Serverauditor?
Serverauditor is an **advanced SSH client** and **classic terminal tool** in a modern fashion. It allows you to login into a remote computer such as a Unix server, a cluster node or a Raspberry Pi using the device you’re using every day — Android, iOS and desktop (as an extension to Chrome). 

Serverauditor is cross-platform and synchronizes user data across every device you use automatically. Our goal is to deliver a consistent user experience across all supported platforms enhancing your productivity and comfort, no matter where you are or how you connect. Serverauditor is secure and takes care of privacy, your data is encrypted using a master password and stored in our Zero-knowledge data store. So you can focus on getting the job done.

Currently, we support SSH and SFTP and a whole bunch of encryption algorithms and security measures. Serverauditor is used to manage a wide variety of devices and services, from **Raspberry pi** and Cisco routers to large node clusters. To use Serverauditor to login into a remote network, you, of course, need to be authorized and possess over the correct credentials.

> **!** Use Serverauditor to tap into your **Raspberry pi** with your [iDevice](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/ios.md) or [Android device](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/android.md).
