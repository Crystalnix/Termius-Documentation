## I've got the error "Please configure your email account..."

In case you haven't configured your email account on your iDevice correctly, you might encounter this error message. Some of Termius's features, such as key import, may require an email account. **This email account is configured in the settings of your device**. 

To do so,
* Navigate to `Device settings` 
* Open `Mail, Contacts, Calendars`
* Tap `Add account`

If you see your email provider in the list you may set your account up [automatically](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201320#automatic). Otherwise, you may add your account [manually](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201320#manual).

> ***!*** Note that an email account is set up, not in Termius but **in the settings of your device**

See [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201320) for more information.
