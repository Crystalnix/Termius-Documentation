Shortcuts work by tapping and holding the Termius icon. A menu with frequently used hosts pops up. By holding the double lined icon on the right of each option you may create a dedicated shortcut of that particular host.

## Terminal tabs
Terminal tabs lets you jump between active sessions quickly.

Active sessions appear at the top of the screen, by swiping horizontally you may switch between them. By tapping the three vertically oriented dots you may alter each individual tap.
