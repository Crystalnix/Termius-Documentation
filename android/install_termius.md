# How to get Termius
###### [[Termius Documentation](../README.md) > [Android](README.md)]

Termius is an advanced SSH client and classic terminal tool in a modern fashion. It allows you to login into a remote computer such as a Unix server, a cluster node or a Raspberry Pi using the device you’re using every day — Android, iOS and desktop).
