## Work with a basic host

To start a session, the user needs to setup a host, this is done in the `Hosts` screen. In our example we'll be connecting to a Raspberry pi in our local network.

## Add a basic host

The `Hosts` screen is the first screen that will appear when you'll open the app for the first time. It shows a big blue `+` on the bottom right corner and sais `Hosts` on the top left.

> ##### ***!*** What is a host?
> Termius is a cross-platform SSH Client. It helps you to connect to- and manage a system or service. If a system or service is prepared to accept SSH connections it is called a host. A host can be found through hostname e.g. ssh.Termius.com or IP address e.g. 192.168.0.21.

To get started with Termius we should add a 'host'. This is done in the Hosts screen.
* Tap the blue `+`
* Them tap `New Host`

A new screen will appear titled `New Host`
* Enter an alias; 'Raspberry Pi', for example
* Enter an IP address or hostname under `hostname`
* Fill out the username and password
* And hit the tick `✓` in the top right corner

> ***!*** IP address, hostname, and credentials are unique to the host you connect with

## Using Identities

By tapping the blue icon ![Identities](../.images/identities.png) on the right to the `Username` field, you may add an identity to the host. An identity is a predefined username in combination with a password or key. One identity can be shared among multiple hosts and host groups and an identity may be [updated](manage_identities.md#edit-or-delete-an-identity) at any time.

> ***!*** Identities are [managed](manage_identities.md) using [Keychain](../features/keychain.md)

## Connect to a host

After tapping the tick, you'll be sent back to the `Hosts` screen. Here you should see the freshly entered host. To connect **tap it once**.

![Requesting Fingerprint](../.images/screenshots/host02.png)

You may see a [security warning](http://www.lysium.de/blog/index.php?/archives/186-How-to-get-ssh-server-fingerprint-information.html). Don’t worry: everything is fine. Hit `Connect`. You’ll only see this warning the first time Termius connects to a host that it hasn’t seen before.

![The Termius terminal](../.images/screenshots/host03.png)

Now a terminal with a prompt should appear, you are connected. Type exit to close the terminal window.

> ##### ***!*** Troubleshooting
> If a dialogue saying `Connection failed Connecting to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx port 22` appears, it is likely you have entered an incorrect IP address. Otherwise, you device might not be hooked up to a network, the host might be turned off, or it may be in a different network than your device.

## Edit or delete a host
A connection might be unsuccessful due to various reasons. For instance, you might have made a typo or the IP address or credentials have changed. In such case, you need to update the host.

Make sure you are on the `Hosts` screen. Tap the menu button in the top left corner, then tap hosts.

Navigate to the host you want to modify, tap and hold, until a blue circle with a tick appears. Now in the top right corner, tap the dustbin ![](../.images/dustbin.png) to delete the host, or the pencil ![](../.images/pencil.png) to alter the host details.

After editing the details hit the tick `✓` in the top right corner, to save the changes.
