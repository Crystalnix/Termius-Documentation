# Extended keyboard
###### [[Termius Documentation](../../README.md) > [Android](../README.md) > [Features and functionality](README.md)]

Sometimes it is hard to find certain keys on a standard Android keyboard. To improve your experience using Termius, we have introduced a customizable extended keyboard.

The extended keyboard is devided in three sections. On the left you will find the [gesture button](terminal_touch.md) and on the right you'll find `display keyboard` and `more`. The mid-section is where the special keys dwell. You may slide the keyboard horizontally to browse through the keys.
