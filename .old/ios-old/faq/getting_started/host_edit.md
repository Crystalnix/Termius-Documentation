## Modify or delete a host
A connection might be unsuccessful due to various reasons. For instance, you might have made a typo, or the IP address or credentials have changed. In such case, you need to update the host.

To do so, on the `Hosts` screen, swipe the particular host to the left, and new functions will appear. Tap edit. A new screen titled `Edit Host` will pop up.
