# Using the extended keyboard

## The function keys
The function keys are ordered in groups of 4 keys, we have taken the liberty to set you up with a bunch of key groups. A number of key groups are directly available by dragging the function keys sideways. You can find all key groups by tapping the `More` button `...`.

## Add and rearrange function keys
The function keys are organized in groups of four; These groups are rearrangeable. This can be done by hitting the `<ore` button and then the gear shaped `Settings` button. A new window opens named 'Manage Groups'.
