# Work with host groups
###### [[Termius Documentation](../../README.md) > [iOS](../README.md) > [Quick start](README.md)]

A clever way to manage multiple hosts is through host `Groups`. With these `Groups` you can collect similar hosts, and manage shared settings in a single action. In our example, we'll be setting up a Raspberry pi fleet in our local network.

* [Add hosts to a group](#add-hosts-to-a-group)
* [Manage groups](#manage-groups)

## Create a host group
Make sure you are in the `Hosts` screen.

To add a host group
* Hit the big blue `+` on the top right of the screen.
* Now tap `New Group`

![Group configuration](../.images/screenshots/groups01.png)

A screen titled `New Group` appears. Here we will fill out the data that our hosts inside the group will have in common. Leave host-specific fields blank.

* Start with the group name; 'Raspberry Fleet' for instance
* Select the protocol you want to use, SSH or Telnet (We select SSH)
* Enter the username, password or key
* You may set up a parent group, and default template as well
* And hit `Save` in the top right corner

> ***!*** Group settings correspond to individual settings of subordinate hosts. When a group setting is changed host settings are automatically changed as well. Note, however, that individual settings overrule group settings

## Add hosts to a group

To add a host to a group you need to change the group field inside the host's configuration.

![Group value](../.images/screenshots/groups03.png)

To add a host to a group by **changing its** `Group` **field value**,
* add a host using the blue `+`
* Before entering any details, tap the `Group` field
* Navigate to the correct group, 'Raspberry Fleet' in our case
* And hit the tick `âœ“` in the top right corner

You will notice that several fields now are filled out automatically. Continue like you would when [adding a basic host](basic_host.md).

## Manage groups

Groups can be organized in subgroups. Subordinate groups adopt the settings of the primary group. Note, however, that individual group settings overrule primary group settings.

![Select group](../.images/screenshots/groups02.png)

All groups appear in the host screen. A group can be edited and one or more selected groups can be removed with a long press.

> ***!*** Note that when deleting a group, all subordinate groups and hosts will be deleted as well!
