Enter an `alias`, this could be ‘Raspberry Pi’, for example. Then enter the IP address under `hostname`. Fill out the `username` and `password` and hit ‘save’ in the top right corner.

> **!** IP address, hostname, and credentials are unique to the host you connect with.

> ### What is a host?
> Serverauditor is a cross-platform SSH Client. It helps you to connect to- and manage a system or service. If a system or service is prepared to accept SSH connections it is called a host. A host can be found through hostname e.g. ssh.serverauditor.com or IP address e.g. 192.168.0.21.
