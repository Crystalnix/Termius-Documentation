## Copy and paste aren't working in the Terminal
To select, copy or paste text in the terminal window you should tap the screen and hold. After a long press new options will appear. 

> **!** Copy and paste may be buggy in case `Speak Selection` is turned on. By toggling `Speak Selection` off you may improve functionality. This can be done under `Settings > General > Accessibility > Speech`.

> **Did you know** that the terminal has an `edit` and `preview` mode. You can change the terminal mode in a single tap. Edit mode is activated when the 'action' buttons are present. Use the preview mode to browse through a session's history.
