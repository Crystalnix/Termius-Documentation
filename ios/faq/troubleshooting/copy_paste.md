## Copy and paste aren't working in the Terminal
To select, copy or paste text in the terminal window you should tap the screen and hold. After a long press new options will appear. 

> **!** Copy and paste may be buggy in case `Speak Selection` in the system settings is turned on. By toggling `Speak Selection` off you may improve functionality. This can be done under `iOS Settings > General > Accessibility > Speech`.
